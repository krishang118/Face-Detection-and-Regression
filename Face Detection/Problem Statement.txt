Problem Statement:

The dataset comprises of images and their masks for the corresponding human faces.

The Objective: To build a face detection system.

Tasks:
(a) Import and understand the data:
• Import and read ‘images.npy’.
• Split the data into Features(X) and labels(Y). Unify shape of all the images. Replace all the pixels within the masked area with 1.
• Split the data into train, validation and test samples.
• Select a random image from the train data, display the original image, and masked image
for it.
(b) Model building:
• Design a face mask detection model. Use MobileNet architecture for the initial pre-trained non-trainable layers. 
Add appropriate Upsampling layers to imitate U-net architecture.
• Design the Dice Coefficient and Loss function.
• Train and tune the model as required.
• Evaluate and share insights on the performance of the model.
(c) Test the model predictions on the test image: ‘image with index 22 in the test data’ and visualize the predicted masks on the faces in the test image.
